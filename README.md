# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 ## Software engineering is a software application or a tool that helps to maintain High-quality Software sytems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
<!-- DESIGNING,  development, PLANNING, testing, deployment, DEBUGING and maintenance.-->
## Designing-- This include comming up with a way of high-level system architecture and detailed design, for example database architecture and user interface.This help developer sand guide them

## Development--The process of starting to code using programming languages to come up with the final project

## Planning -- The planning phase ensures that the project has a clear roadmap and that all stakeholders are aligned on the objectives and expectations.

## Testing -- The process involeves searching for bugs that may bring conflicts and also involes making sure that the code is responsive and there are a lot of things that could be tested

## Deployment --The goal is to release the software in a controlled manner and ensure it is operational.The project becomes live and any one can view your web. 

## Maintenance -- During this phase, the software is monitored, and any issues, bugs, or changes are addressed. Maintenance can include bug fixes, performance improvements, and updates to accommodate new requirements or environments.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

<!-- Structure , Documentary , Timeline , Flexibility -->
## Agile allows for continuous feedback, adaptation, and changes throughout the project.

##  This means that parts of the project can be delivered to users sooner, allowing for early feedback and adjustments.

## Planning: Waterfall requires comprehensive planning upfront, while Agile allows for adaptive planning throughout the project.

## Change Management: Waterfall is less accommodating to changes after a phase is completed, whereas Agile thrives on continuous change and feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

### Software developers are responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications.

### QA engineers focus on ensuring the quality of the software product through  testing and validation.

### The project manager is responsible for overseeing the software development process from start to finish, ensuring project is finished by time


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
